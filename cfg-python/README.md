# About this folder

This is a folder containing work I did as part of the Code First Girls course "Introduction to Python" that I completed in early 2022. 

Inside this folder you will be able to see homework I did including using turtle, creating simple if/else programmes and interacting with an API. 

There is also a folder titled 'SpreadsheetProject' which shows the work I did as part of the final project. This required for me to create a programme that would assist a user with calculating sales. For more info, please see the README in the project folder.
