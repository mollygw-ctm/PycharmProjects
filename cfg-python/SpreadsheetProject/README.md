# About SpreadsheetProject

## What the programme is about:

In the final part of the course from CFG on Intro to Python, I worked on a spreadsheet Project. The brief as follows was given:

> In this project you'll use Python to do very basic data analysis on a spreadsheet. The standard project will use csv file that contains fake sales data. After completing the required tasks you are free to change the csv file that you use.
The csv file for the standard project is called sales.csv
>
>Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.
>1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
>2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
>3. Output the total sales across all months

For this project I worked on the project brief initially and then extended on the project by providing more options for the user such as calculating the average, finding high and low values and adding to the sales csv file. I also created user interaction via the console allowing for the user to select an option that could then be carried out. 

## How to run the programme:
- Ensure you have pandas installed
- Be in the folder 'SpreadsheetProject'
- Run `python spreadsheetproject_defs.py` in the terminal
